# Python Learning Progress

This repository contains my practice code for the "Python Basics"

Topics Covered
Core Fundamentals: Loops, Lists, Functions, and File Handling.
Mini Tasks:
  - Counting headings in a document (`count.py`).
  - Extracting the longest words from a text (`longest_words.py`).
  - Basic arithmetic operations (`Arithmetic_operators.py`).

How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run any script using Python (e.g., `python longest_words.py`).
